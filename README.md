This repository contains the source code and data for a demonstrator application developed as part of the [XAIface project ](https://www.chistera.eu/projects/xaiface).
. The application showcases an end-to-end explainable face recognition system, providing users with an interactive interface to conduct face verification explainability experiments.

Users can select key parameters such as probe-gallery pairs, face compression and beautification tools, and verification and explainability methods. Once selections are made, the system displays relevant conditions and results, including the verification setup, selected face images and verification outcomes, soft biometric characteristics, filtered or decoded images with verification and compression results, and explainability heat maps.

This setup enables users to analyze and better understand the performance and explainability of face verification processes. The demonstrator application is publicly available [here](https://xaiface-demo.streamlit.app/).

Figure below depicts the user interactive interface layout of the demonstrator application.
